A new take on the roguelike genre, combining the professions and social aspects of The Guild, the party-based combat of console RPGs, and the random worlds of Dwarf Fortress.

Adventures in Reptoran will allow the player to make the world their own, whether that means slaying monsters, starting a business, or even establishing a family line.  The game is as deep as you make it.
